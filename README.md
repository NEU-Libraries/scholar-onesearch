#### Primo Frontend for Northeastern University Libraries


This is the repository for the CSS and Javascript to override the default styles of Exlibiris's Primo appplication. The CSS is authored using the awesome Bootstrap project, I am hoping to incorporate the font-awesome project.

Credits to:
* [bootstrap v3.0.0](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap)
* [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

To compile LESS check out the documentation at [LESS Project Page](http://lesscss.org/), but I used [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess).
