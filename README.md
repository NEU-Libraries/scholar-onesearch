<h1>Scholar OneSearch<small> | Primo Frontend for Northeastern University Libraries</small></h1>

## 

This is the repository for the CSS and Javascript to override the default styles of Exlibiris's Primo appplication. The CSS is authored using the awesome Bootstrap project, I am hoping to incorporate the font-awesome project as well, although challenging. 

Credits to:
* [bootstrap v3.0.0](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap)
* [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

To compile LESS check out the documentation at [LESS Project Page](http://lesscss.org/), but I used [recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess).
