  <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>
      Scholar OneSearch provides simple, one-stop searching for books, articles, digital media, and more. Local Northeastern collections and global resources can all be discovered through Scholar OneSearch, with many items available in full text online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scholar OneSearch also helps you manage your research: renew books and videos, create lists, export citations to Refworks and Endnote Web, and order materials from other libraries. Be sure to sign in with your myNEU credentials to view full search results--some databases, like Web of Science, only show results when you’re signed in.

  <h3>What happened to NUCat?</h3>
    <p>
      Scholar OneSearch indexes all of the books, e-books, videos, journals, and other collections from our legacy catalog, NUCat, with the option to search and retrieve more, including articles, proceedings, and digital materials.

      Limit your search by choosing “Library Collections” from the drop-down above to find print materials held at Snell Library, the Law Library, and the African American Institute.
